In this take of the classic board game you play the role of the detective solving the murder case at mystery mansion! You must determine the correct killer, weapon and room before time runs out; but be aware, the suspects may try to throw you off their track!  

This game was made in python with pygame.

Made with Emily Gwin! :heartpulse:
